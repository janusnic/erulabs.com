      span.title In the beginning...
    p In the beginning, there was HTML. And for a while, it was good. Then came CSS and JavaScript and for a while, that was good too. The static site was born and then died immediately. It's killer - the back end - was armed to the teeth with power and possibility. First PERL and later PHP scripts regularly wrote out HTML and sometimes even JavaScript - as we layered technologies one on top of each other things started to get messy. Applications regularly tightly depended on specific application settings (Apache rewrite rules anyone?), or had bizarre dependencies which for some reason only RedHat EL 4 satisfies. What began as a "Look what I can do!" quickly evolved into "Oh god what did I do?".
    p Then came the frameworks. Ruby-on-Rails - a framework which in an organized way bundled up all the tricks of the past decade - It had built in caching, error handling, routing, database abstraction and instead of a thousand tricks, we had one beast of a framework - and for a while, it was good too. But things didn't stop there. The PHP community released Symfony and Drupal which packaged the majority of what made Rails special - the Python community released Django - the PERL folks released about 10 frameworks that no one used - .NET is a thing - and more recently, a small group of people wrote Node.js - A server framework for Javascript based on Google's V8. And boy, was it ever good.
    p
      | Now JavaScript had it's problems (oh&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html') did it ever
      | ), but it was required knowledge - JavaScript is the language of the browser and therefore the language of the web. We used it for our animations and our AJAX then forgot about it - preferring to focus on what was really important for most developers - the server. But time marched on, and as JavaScript improved and Node.js gained popularity, some wondered why we'd even bother using anything
      i but
      |  Javascript. Why not unify? A single language for the web - for servers and browsers!
    p
      | Behind all this web development, systems administrators were getting work done too. Reliance on single points of failure were eliminated one by one - large infrastructures were virtualized - scales of economy kicked in, and the Cloud was born. In a hurry, developers worth their salt realized their applications needed to be able to be deployed in moments - needed to bundle everything they depended on. Suddenly, it was possible to write code which described and was able to deploy an entire environment. Suddenly, developers were coding their operations. Instead of asking a SysAdmin for a server, I can execute a line of code and get one in moments! Suddenly, it became possible to write code for more than servers and browsers -&nbsp;
      b we started to write code for infrastructures.
      | With the availability of JavaScript SDKs for Cloud providers - we now have a single language which can deliver the entirety of the web - the client, the server, and the cloud.

      span.title These days...
    p
      | So where are we now? Is it even possible for a normal web developer to build a web application any more? Which frameworks to pick? Which clouds to use? Do we need a team of 10 experts and a corporate SLA? This article will come in a few parts, and we'll work up to the full web application and talk about all the pieces - but for now let's start by going back in time and creating a static site - A site like we would have made before we started renaming our .html files as .php because we wanted a page changer or some text entry field. Let's reject hacky tricks and reject billion line frameworks.&nbsp;
      b Let's build a modern website.
    p
      i Note: The only requirement for this tutorial is an understanding of JavaScript
    p These days we have a lot of requirements. We want:
      ul
        li A single language for the "full stack" - client, server and cloud
        li No bloated frameworks and a very minimal production dependency chain
        li The most modern tools and a highly configurable build system with all the usual tricks (and some new ones)
        li The ability to describe and deploy to our production infrastructure in code
        li Deep application performance monitoring and infrastructure monitoring
    p To answer the questions, we'll use JavaScript, Node.js, Gulp.js &amp; Browserify, SaltStack and NewRelic respectively. Part one of this series will cover the first three - while part two will deal with the server and infrastructure.

      a(href='https://windows.github.com/') install GitHub
      |  to get a version of git and a better console to work with. Once installed, use the "GitHub Shell" and type "bash". Now you're ready! You'll also want a nice editor - I recommend GitHub's&nbsp;
      a(href='https://atom.io/') Atom.
    p Let's start a new project! We'll use NPM, the brilliant Node.js package manager.

      | We'll tell git to ignore our node modules - we'll track this using our "package.json" file we created using 'npm init'
    p
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | echo "node_modules" &gt; .gitignore
    p
      | Next let's create the skeleton of our project - a few directories where we'll keep our application organized - we'll use the common 'src' for our source files and 'dist' for our "compiled" site.
    p
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | mkdir -p dist/assets &amp;&amp; mkdir -p src/assets

      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right

    p
      | Notice that we used '--save-dev', which automatically writes our dependencies to our package.json file.

      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | npm install
      |  and NPM will install all our dependencies!

      span.title Cookin' with fire
    p
      | Now let's setup Gulp.js - Gulp by default will look for a "gulpfile.js" - in the gulpfile we'll define some tasks which will build our site. When I say 'build', we'll start with simply copying the files into a directory called "dist" (for distributing). Later in the tutorial we can add all kinds of fun things to our gulpfile (Like LESS, Jade, Browserify, etc etc). Create a new "gulpfile.js" in your project directory using whatever editor you prefer:
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | var gulp = require('gulp');
        | gulp.task('html', function () {
        |   gulp.src('src/index.html').pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
        | });
    p
      | Take a moment to read through that - all we're doing is telling "gulp" that our HTML task simply copies src/index.html to dist/. This might seem fairly pointless right now, but we're just getting started! Let's add a task to copy our CSS and our images as well! (These go after the "});" in the last blurb)
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | gulp.task('css', function () {
        |   gulp.src('src/style.css').pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets'));
        | });
        | gulp.task('assets', function () {
        |   gulp.src("src/assets/**/*").pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets'));
        | });
    p Now, from the command line, a&nbsp;
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | gulp html
      | ,&nbsp;
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | gulp css
      | , etc will copy your files from your "src/" directory into your "dist/" directory. Let's bundle those steps for convenience!
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | gulp.task('default', [ 'html', 'css', 'assets' ]);
    p Now, at the command line, in the root of your project, you can simply&nbsp;
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | gulp
      | ! Let's add something useful, to illustrate Gulp's power. Let's use the excellent&nbsp;
      a(href='http://lesscss.org/') LESS
      |  instead of boring old CSS. Let's rewrite our 'css' gulp task:
    p
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | npm install gulp-less gulp-rename --save-dev
      | , then...
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | var less = require('gulp-less');\n
        | var rename = require('gulp-rename');\n
        | gulp.task('css', function () {\n
        |   gulp.src('src/style.less')\n
        |     .pipe(less())\n
        |     // Since we don't want our compiled CSS to be named "style.less",\n
        |     // we'll use "gulp-rename":\n
        |     .pipe(rename('style.css'))\n
        |     .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets'));\n
        | });
    p Huray! No need for editor plugins - no need for tiresome build tasks - no need for massive frameworks - simply
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | gulp
      | and go! At the end of this article, I'll show some examples for my favorite gulp plugins. Most sites will probably want to minify HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They'll probably want to error check the JavaScript using something like&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.jshint.com/') jshint
      | . We can even use Gulp to deploy our static site! Before we get to deployment, let's go a step further. Let's build a development server with livereload! Sounds complex doesn't it? Not so much:
    p
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | npm install gulp-connect --save-dev
      | , then...
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | var connect = require('gulp-connect');
        | gulp.task('connect', [ 'default' ], function () {
        |   connect.server({
        |     root: 'dist',
        |     port: 9000,
        |     livereload: true
        |   });
        | });
    p
      | You can now run a&nbsp;
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | gulp connect
      |  and blamo!&nbsp;
      a(href='http://localhost:9000') http://localhost:9000
      |  - Time to celebrate!
    p
      | But wait - if you change your app/index.html, nothing happens :O Let's solve that by watching our "src" directory and reloading the development server when we notice something changes!
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | var path = require('path');
        | gulp.task('watch', [ 'connect' ], function () {
        |   gulp.watch('src/**/*', { read: false }, function (event) {
        |     // So we'll check which file was changed and send a
        |     // message over to our dev server telling it to reload
        |     var reloadAsset = 'index.html';
        |     // We'll do all tasks by default when we see anything change
        |     var taskName = 'default';
        |     // But if we see a common file change, we can specifically reload that file
        |     // and specifically rerun only that task
        |     switch (path.extname(event.path)) {
        |       case '.html':
        |         reloadAsset = 'index.html';
        |         taskName = 'html';
        |         break;
        |       case '.less':
        |         reloadAsset = 'assets/style.css';
        |         taskName = 'css';
        |         break;
        |     }
        |     gulp.task('reloadBrowser', [ taskName ], function () {
        |       gulp.src('dist/' + reloadAsset).pipe(connect.reload());
        |     });
        |     gulp.start('reloadBrowser');
        |   });
        | });
    p
      | You'll need the&nbsp;
      a(href='http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions') LiveReload
      |  plugin for your browser - once setup you can go to&nbsp;
      a(href='http://localhost:9000') http://localhost:9000
      |  and start making changes to your site! Watch and changes are reloaded in mere microseconds! In my tests, all 3 tasks and the browser refresh take less than 1 millisecond!
    p
      | Spend a moment adding some content to your site - play with Gulp if you need anything else (
      a(href='https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp-coffee') Coffeescript
      | ?&nbsp;
      a(href='https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-jade') Jade
      | ?&nbsp;
      a(href='https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-jshint') JSHint
      | ?). Once you're done playing with livereload, let's deploy your site!

      span.title Quickly! To the Cloudmobile!
    p
      | So what do we have so far? We have version control, we have dependency tracking, and we have an awesome streaming build system. We have everything we need to build a modern site, so now let's build a system to deploy it to the world! We'll use the excellent&nbsp;
      a(href='https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud') pkgcloud
      |  to stream our 'dist' directory (the final product of our build) to the cloud!
    p
      | While pkgcloud works with all the major providers, I'll focus on&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.rackspace.com/') Rackspace
      | 's&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/') Cloud Files
      | . Full disclosure: I'm a Racker, and love Cloud Files - other clouds are available (and pkgcloud works with them just as well!)
    p
      | I'll be using a feature of Cloud Files called&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-cloud-files-how-to-create-a-static-website/') Static Site
      |  - If you're not a Rackspace user, you can create an account&nbsp;
      a(href='http://developer.rackspace.com/devtrial/') here and get $300 free credit
      | . At $0.12/GB for CDN bandwidth, that means you can do 415GB of bandwidth per month for 6 months for essentially nothing - and with our Gulp automatically compressing and minifying files, we can stretch that 415GB to millions and millions of visitors!
    p Once you're logged into your Rackspace Cloud Control panel, select "Files" and then create a new container. When prompted for the type, select "Static Site". The container name doesn't matter, but remember it for the next step! You can point your domain (if you have one) at the URL for the Cloud Files container using a CNAME record.
    p
      | So, without further ado, let's build our deployment system! We'll build it directly into Gulp for our static site example (in future articles we'll buff this up considerably). I mentioned we'd use pkgcloud - for the sake of this articles length, we'll use the wrapped&nbsp;
      a(href='https://github.com/pieceoftoast/gulp-cloudfiles') gulp-cloudfiles
      |  which is a&nbsp;
      a(href='https://github.com/pieceoftoast/gulp-cloudfiles/blob/master/index.js') short script
      |  which wraps pkgcloud.
    kbd
      span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
      | npm install gulp-cloudfiles --save-dev
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | var cloudfiles = require('cloud-files');
        | var rackspace = {
        |   username: 'RACKSPACE_USERNAME_HERE',
        |   apiKey: 'RACKSPACE_APIKEY_HERE',
        |   // The region you created your container in:
        |   // Valid values are 'IAD', 'DFW', 'ORD', 'AUS', 'HKG', 'LON'
        |   region: 'IAD',
        |   container: 'RACKSPACE_CONTAINER_NAME'
        | };
        | var deployOptions = {
        |   delay: 0,
        |   uploadPath: ""
        | };
        | // Let's check the arguments - if we typed 'gulp deploy'
        | // we'll set the deploy variable to true
        | var deploy = process.argv[2] === 'deploy' ? true : false;
    p Awesome - now we have the ability to upload to cloud files - make sure to set the proper information in the "rackspace" object. "deployOptions.delay" allows you to set a time delay between uploading files, while "deployOptions.uploadPath" allows you to prefix files with a particular path.
    p All that's left now is to modify our gulp tasks to be aware of the "deploy" variable. If we're deploying, we'll stream the files to the cloud! Let's rewrite our 'html' task first:
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | gulp.task('html', function () {
        |   var stream = gulp.src('src/index.html').pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
        |   if (deploy) {
        |     stream.pipe(cloudfiles(rackspace, deployOptions));
        |   }
        | });
    p So gulp knows what we want to do when deploying, we'll link up a "deploy" task to  run all our default tasks:
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | gulp.task('deploy', [ 'default' ]);
    p Now,
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | gulp deploy
      |  - Congrats, you've built a complete web application!

  .section
    .header
      span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
      span.title Browserify, bundles, and all sorts of good stuff
    p So we've already built a great system which solves a huge number of issues. We have zero reliance on a server (or any single point of failure). We're being hosted by a massive CDN with over 200 edge locations. Our CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and even our images can be compressed automatically by Gulp. What else is there? Well, one of the answers to that is bundles. LESS is already achieving this for us - we have Gulp compile our single 'src/style.less' file into a style.css file in 'dist/' - but in our LESS file, we can use
      a(href='http://lesscss.org/features/#features-overview-feature-importing') @import
      | . This will pull in the contents of another LESS file. But when converted to CSS - suddenly we have a "bundle" - in other words, X number of LESS files in 'src/' become ONE CSS file in 'dist/'. In our HTML we only need to use one single:
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style.css"&gt;
    p Since our "gulp watch" task is basing its actions off the file extension, and since it will run the "css" task every time it sees a change to a ".less" file, we can now edit _any included .less_ file and the browser will still reload! All our styles are being "bundled". This drastically improved browser load times by reducing HTTP request overhead.
    p But that's just CSS! Let's do the same to JavaScript! In fact, why use some new command? Why not continue to use Node.js's "require()" that we've been using this whole tutorial? Enter&nbsp;
      a(href='http://browserify.org/') Browserify
      | . Let's write a new Gulp task for Javascript!
    p
      kbd
        span.glyphicon.glyphicon-chevron-right
        | npm install browserify vinyl-source-stream --save-dev
    .note gulpfile.js
    pre.language-javascript
      code
        | var browserify = require('browserify');
        | var source = require('vinyl-source-stream');
        | gulp.task('javascript', function () {
        |   var stream = browserify({
        |     entries: [ './src/index.js' ],
        |     extensions: [ '.js' ]
        |   })
        |     .bundle()
        |     .pipe(source('bundle.js'))
        |     .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets'));
        |   if (deploy) {
        |     stream.pipe(cloudfiles(rackspace, deployOptions));
        |   }
        | });
    p Now we've got the ability to use "require()" in our 'src/index.js'! We can now bundle X number of JavaScript files into a single JavaScript bundle! This means the HTML only needs one single:
    pre.language-javascript
      code
       | &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    p And yes, you can&nbsp;
      kbd require('jquery');
      |  or&nbsp;
      kbd require('angular');
      |  if you want - those files will automatically be bundled up into your 'dist/assets/bundle.js' (and minified if you choose to do so).

      span.title In summary

    p
      | We just built quite a lot! We have a new site project, we got a nice developer discount from Rackspace, we have a build system which we can easily extend to include our favorite technologies, we have a built-in development server which never touches or mucks up our code base - we have a production environment which we can deploy to - we even have bundles for CSS and JavaScript to improve load times and reduce bandwidth overhead!
    p
      | There are still a lot of improvements to make. We can add:
